        <p> I chose to go to babson because the campus was beautiful, it was close to the city, and it had an amazing business program.
I thought the people were friendly and it was hard to get in</p>
<p> My favorite sport is ice hockey.  I love to skate and have done it all my life.  When I was looking at where to go, one of the reasons I chose Babson 
was beacuse of their women's ice hockey program.  It is funny that I now no longer ice skate, but run for the track team</p>
