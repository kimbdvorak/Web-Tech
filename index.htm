		<h2> About Me </h2>
	
        <p> <img src="images/Michelle Kristen Kim.jpg" alt="Our picture" title="a photo of friendship" width="400"/> (Me on the left). I chose to go to <a href="http://www.babson.edu/Pages/default.aspx">Babson College</a></a> mainly because of four reasons.  First, it had
		an amazing business program.  I knew before college that I wanted to pursue business, and when I saw Babson College's business listing I was
		 surprised in the best way.  Not only that, but Babson was exactly where I wanted it to be.  It is right outside Boston and has a beautiful
		 campus.  Thirdly, Babson College is prestigous.  It's not easy to get in here, and I feel as though I am studying among the best and the
		 brightest. Lastly, I chose Babson becuase it had a Women's Ice Hockey program.  I find this funny, since I do not play ice hockey anymore. After 
		 college, I hope to pursue environental sustainabiliy and work in Boston.  I want to make a positive impact on the world. </p>

	<h2> My Interests </h2>
	<a id="MyInterests"></a>
	<p> My favorite sport is <a href="http://bruins.nhl.com/club/schedule.htm">Ice Hockey</a></a>.  I love to skate and have done it all my life.  When I was looking at where to go, one of the reasons I chose Babson 
	was beacuse of their women's ice hockey program.  It is funny that I now no longer ice skate, but run for the track team. My favorite player is Milan Lucic.  He played for the bruins.
	My other interests include ceramics, playing Mario Kart, biking, and hiking. </p>
