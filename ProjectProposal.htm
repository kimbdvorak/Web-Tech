        <h3> What is your website about? </h3>
             <p> My dad owns a timing company.  We time 5k runs, triathlons, bike races, track meets, cross country skiing and more.  
            He has a website, but it looks horrible.  My website would show his business and the exceptional quality of service in a 
            way that appeases the eye and looks professional. </p>
        <h3> What is the objective of the website? </h3>
            <p>   The website would have two primary objectives.  First, it would need to have good SEO as we want people to find our website when
               they search for timing in the New England area.  The second objective is a place where people can look at the results of their race. </p>
        <h3> Who is your target audiance? </h3>
            <p> Our target auduance are meet managers as well as the people that run in the races.  The meet managers are the ones we want to capture to
            gain their business.  The people that run the races will be looking at the website for their results, whether it be biking, skiing, running, 
            swimming, etc. </p>
        <h3> What content do you plan to include in each page of your website? </h3>
            <p> There would be multiple tabs.  First, there would need to be a homepage, which would be simple and have a few pictures with some quick
                links.  There would also have to be an 'about us' page, that would say a little about the history of my dad's company.  Here would then 
                need to be a page that lists our services and encourages people to contact us on a contact page.  Finally, there would need to be a 
                results page, which would list all of the results of the races we have done in a way that would be easily accessable to people on their
                smart phones.  There could also be an image gallery, where photos of our services could possibly be found. </p>
